## Platform Operations

### üîó Invitation System
The core of Twryd's B2B relationship management:

1. **Supplier Sends Invitation**
   - Supplier creates invitation from their dashboard
   - System generates unique invitation token
   - Invitation sent to client via email/link

2. **Client Receives Invitation**
   - Client clicks invitation link (`/invitation/:token`)
   - System validates invitation token
   - If not logged in, redirects to client login with invitation token

3. **Client Accepts Invitation**
   - Client logs in (if required)
   - System processes invitation acceptance
   - Establishes business relationship between supplier and client

4. **Relationship Established**
   - Client gains access to supplier's catalog
   - Client-specific discounts become available
   - Order placement becomes possible

### üõçÔ∏è Product Management Workflow
1. **Category Setup** (Admin)
   - Admin creates product categories
   - Categories are available for supplier use

2. **Product Creation** (Supplier)
   - Supplier adds products with details
   - Sets pricing, descriptions, and images
   - Assigns products to categories
   - Configures active/inactive status

3. **Product Discovery** (Client)
   - Clients browse supplier catalogs
   - View product details and pricing
   - Access client-specific discounts

### üí∞ Discount Management System
**Two-tier discount structure:**

1. **Client-Based Discounts**
   - Supplier sets specific discount percentages for individual clients
   - Applied across all products for that client
   - Managed from supplier dashboard

2. **Product Discounts**
   - Supplier applies discounts to specific products
   - Available to all clients or specific client groups
   - Product-specific pricing rules
